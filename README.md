# VIDEO LOOM

## Environment setup

### windows (WSL2)

1. In order to allow rendering in WSL2. We need to ensure Xming is installed.
2. Before starting development, launch application "XLaunch"
3. Follow below steps, for `Additional parameters for VcXsrv`, type `-ac`

<img src="./img/xlaunch_1.png" width="400" height="300" />
<img src="./img/xlaunch_2.png" width="400" height="300" />
<img src="./img/xlaunch_3.png" width="400" height="300" />

3. After above steps, click `Finish` and launch Xming
4. Once Xming is launched, we'll need to configure the `$DISPLAY` variable to point to the local machine's IP. To do that, open a terminal and follow below steps:

```bash
$cat /etc/resolv.conf

# this is what you will see
# # This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# # [network]
# # generateResolvConf = false
# nameserver 172.27.176.1

$export DISPLAY=172.27.176.1:0 # ensure :0 appended in the end
```

5. Now you can run `python3 <app_name>.py` to execute programs
